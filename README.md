# Readability Importer

Well, it really is just a ReadItLater to Readability importer.

This runs on Sinatra and requires a bunch of gems, as you can see in the source. Use it at your own risk, after putting your relevant keys into the environment. 

# Working demo

I have this deployed on Heroku here: http://readability-importer.heroku.com

# Development

This was an evening with Sinatra and OAuth. It could use a lot of cleaning up and beautification. If you want to help, you know the drill. Fork, change, pull request, enjoy.
